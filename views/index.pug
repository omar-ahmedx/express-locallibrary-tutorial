    p The library has the following record counts:

    ul
      li #[strong Books:] !{data.book_count}
      li #[strong Copies:] !{data.book_instance_count}
      li #[strong Copies available:] !{data.book_instance_available_count}
      li #[strong Authors:] !{data.author_count}
      li #[strong Genres:] !{data.genre_count} 
      //- We didn't escape the count values (i.e. we used the !{} syntax) because the count values are calculated. If the information was supplied by end-users then we'd escape the variable for display.
